<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">A few days ago on the 21st of March, our school celebrated Harmony Day. Harmony Day is a day where we can celebrate the diversity and cultures of people from all over the world here. To celebrate Harmony Day, we dressed up either in traditional clothes or something orange. Everyone gathered up outside and we did a little parade for each grade. It was lovely seeing what everyone was wearing and their pride of where they come from.<br> The 5/6's did a few activities on the topic of Harmony Day. First, we did a crossword with a partner theat included words related to Harmony Day. Then, we also learnt how to say hello in others languages. Overall, it was a wonderful day and I especially loved seeing everyone's outfits. I would say that Harmony Day is a very important time because it's where we can celebrate our differences, various backgrounds and personalities.  </p>

  <h4>St John's Clifton Hill Visit</h4>

  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Last Friday, the 5/6s went to Clifton Hill to meet with the students from St John's. The 5/6s had their lunch and played with the other kids. Before going off to the playground, we had to do an activity. We had to do "speed dating" where we had to stand in front of one of the St John's kids and say something about yourself until the timer went off. Then we had to move around in a circle and talk to other students. Then, we could go on the playground to hang out with everyone. It was pretty fun and exciting.</p>

The 5/6s are super excited to go to camp. They will be doing activities with the students at St John's Clifton Hill. They will also be doing a 2 hour surfing lesson at the beach and might also be able to see penguins!</p>
